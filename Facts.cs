              "Did you know a pokémon with all 18 types would still be weak to Rock?",
              "In one of the episodes, Ash actually transforms in a Pikachu. A pokémon Witch transforms him so he can 'talk' to pokemon. He does keep on talking in human speak though.",
              "Did you know Doduo just runs really fast if it uses Fly? Pokémon Stadium is proof.",
              "Did you know Arcenine was a legendary at first? A remnant of this can be found in his description: 'The Legendary Pokémon'",
              "Did you know Munna was mentioned for the very first time in Pokémon Red? That's 4 generations in advance!",
              "Azurill is the only Pokémon that can change Genders when Evolving! One out of Four change gender when evolving.",
              "It is said no two Spinda have the same pattern. To ensure that the Game Devs made sure there are over 4 billion different spot-patterns!",
              "Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee are named after Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee respectively... No wonder they're good at martial arts.",
              "Splash is known as the most useless normal type move ever (until Z-moves where introduced), but did you know it was supposed to be called 'Hop'?",
              "Did you know Kangaskhan might have been an evolution to Cubone? This is hinted at on several occasions, but mostly in the fact you can catch a Kangaskhan by SOS battling a Cubone in Pokémon Sun and Moon!",
              "Did you know Ash would have been running around with a Clefairy if not for some change of heart?",
              "Clefable has a living shadow in Gengar, the silhouettes of both pokémon look quite alike, and Gengar is even known as the 'shadow pokémon'.",
              "The 'legend of the White Hand' is so prominent in the Pokémon Universe, that the game Pokémon Red, Green and Blue had it, and there's a reference to it in the Pokémon Anime.",
              "The only pokémon banned out of the episodes is 'Porygon'. However it is actually Pikachu that caused it to get banned. He used a lightning bolt on a rocket Team Rocket send to the main Characters, being the cause of many epileptic attacks in Japanese kids. After the episode 'Electric Soldier Porygon' he is never seen again.",
              "In the episode 'The Legend of Dratini' Ash meets a Dratini, and catches a whole herd of Tauros. These are mentioned over and over again in later episodes, but since 'The Legend of Dratini' is a banned episode, because of guns, it's unknown how he'd get the Tauros in the series.",
              "Jynx was a black colored pokémon until the episode 'Holiday Hi-Jynx', after this protests arose and Jynx changed from complete blackness to purple. "
